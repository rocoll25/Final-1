What the code does
	The user is asked if they’ve run the code before
		If no, the user is asked for their first name and year of birth. This is used to create an “account” for them, where all their “collections” are stored.
		If yes, the user can access the “collections” associated with their “account”
	If the user just got an “account,” they’re given a tutorial
	If not, or after the tutorial, the screen clears and the user is given a few options
	The options are:
		Create new collection
		Add to collection
		Display full collection
		Search collection
	And that’s it

How the database stuff is organized
	Accounts database
	The first two rows hold first names and years of birth
	The following rows contain the collections the user has created, up to five
	The information is stored but using 2D arrays for the data and one array for the column labels
